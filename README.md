# Event Link Generator

Create links to add events via `Outlook`, `Google`, `Yahoo` calendars or using `icl` file.

## Timezones troubleshooting

Creating correct dates for users in different timezones maybe complicated. It also depends in which environment you use the library - Node server, Node CLI/Browser. To avoid related issues `event-link-generator` converts all dates to `UTC` timezone. It's necessary to consider it when you constructs date objects. If you would like to know how to create correct dates in all possible cases, please, read the manual [How to work with dates]().
